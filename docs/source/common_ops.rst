Common Graph Operations
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Many common graph operations map to simple operators in :py:mod:`graphi`.
Unless parameters are needed, builtin operations usually suffice.
For example, the outdegree of a node is simply its number of outgoing edges, i.e.

.. code::

    out_degree = len(graph[node])

in a directed graph.
Since :py:mod:`graphi` makes heavy use of data views (instead of copies), this has optimal performance.

Nodes of a graph
----------------

Graphs behave like a :py:class:`set` with regard to :term:`nodes <node>`.
Note that removing a :term:`node` also invalidates all its :term:`edges <edge>` and their :term:`values <edge value>`.

.. describe:: graph[a] = True
              graph.add(a)
              graph.discard(a)

    Safely add or remove a :term:`node` ``a`` from ``graph``.

.. describe:: del graph[a]

    Remove a :term:`node` ``a`` from ``graph``.

.. describe:: a in graph

    Whether there is a :term:`node` ``a`` in ``graph``.

.. describe:: list(graph)
              iter(graph)
              for a in graph:

    List/iterate/traverse all :term:`nodes <node>` in ``graph`` .

.. describe:: len(graph)

    The number of :term:`nodes <node>` in the graph.

Edges and values of a graph
---------------------------

Graphs special-case :term:`edges <edge>`: an :term:`edge` is a secondary key,
being the value to :term:`nodes <node>` and the key to :term:`edge values <edge value>`.

.. describe:: Edge[a:b] in graph

    Whether there is an :term:`edge` from :term:`node` ``a`` to :term:`node` ``b`` in ``graph``.

.. describe:: Loop[a] in graph
              Edge[a:a] in graph

    Whether there is a :term:`loop` from :term:`node` ``a`` to itself in ``graph``.

.. describe:: list(graph[a])
              iter(graph[a])
              for b in graph[a]:

    List/iterate/loop all :term:`nodes <node>` ``b`` for which there is an
    edge from :term:`node` ``a`` to :term:`node` ``b``.

.. describe:: len(graph[a])

    The number of outgoing :term:`edges <edge>` of :term:`node` ``a``, i.e. its :term:`outdegree`.

Edge values of a graph
----------------------

Graphs behave similar to a :py:class:`dict`, tying :term:`values <edge value>` to :term:`edges <edge>`.
Note that removing a :term:`node` also invalidates all its :term:`edges <edge>` and their :term:`values <edge value>`.

.. describe:: graph[a:b] = w
              graph[Edge[a:b]] = w

    Add an :term:`edge` from :term:`node` ``a`` to :term:`node` ``b`` with :term:`value <edge value>` ``w``.

Pythonic Graph Types
++++++++++++++++++++

By default, every graph is a weighted, directed graph
- :term:`edges <edge>` are oriented from start to end :term:`node` and have one :term:`edge value`.
However, other graph types can be created with standard language features.

.. describe:: graph[a:b] = True

    Add an :term:`edge` from :term:`node` ``a`` to :term:`node` ``b`` with
    the primitive :term:`value <edge value>` :py:const:`True`.

    This creates an unweighted graph.

.. describe:: graph[a:b] = [w1, w2, w3, ...]
              graph[a:b] = w1, w2, w3, ...

    Add an :term:`edge` from :term:`node` ``a`` to :term:`node` ``b`` with
    multiple :term:`values <edge value>` ``w1, w2, w3, ...``.

    This creates a multigraph.
