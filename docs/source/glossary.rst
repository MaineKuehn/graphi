    loop
        An edge from a node to itself.
        Counts as both an ingoing *and* outgoing edge for :term:`outdegree`, :term:`indegree` and :term:`degree`.

    indegree
        The number of ingoing edges of a node.
        If a node has a :term:`loop`, it also counts as an ingoing edge.

    outdegree
        The number of outgoing edges of a node.
        If a node has a :term:`loop`, it also counts as an outgoing edge.

    degree
        The number of ingoing and outgoing edges of a node.
        If a node has a :term:`loop`, it counts as both an ingoing and outgoing edge.

        The :term:`degree` of a node is the sum of its :term:`indegree` and :term:`outdegree`.

    graph
        A collection of :term:`nodes <node>`, :term:`edges <edge>` between them
        and possibly :term:`values <edge value>` associated with any :term:`edges <edge>`.

    edge
    arrow
        A connection between two :term:`nodes <node>` in a :term:`graph`.

    edge value
    weight
        The value associated with an :term:`edge` in a :term:`graph`.
