class Graph(abc_collection.Container):
    """
    Abstract Base Class for graphs representing values of edges between nodes

    A :py:class:`~.Graph` is a container for primitive nodes and edges.
    There are three types of elements handled by a graph:

    1. primitive *nodes*,

    2. slice-like *edges* as pairs of nodes, and

    3. primitive *edge values*.

    Both nodes and edge values are conceptually similar to keys and values of :py:class:`dict`.
    However, the concept of node pairs as edges adds additional functionality.
    The fixed relation between arbitrary nodes ``a, b`` and the directed pair ``a:b`` creates two value-type layers:

    1. each *node* is mapped to all its outgoing edges,

    2. each *edge* is mapped to the respective edge value.

    In short, ``graph[a]`` provides a collection of edges originating at ``a``,
    while ``graph[a:b]`` provides the specific edge value from ``a`` to ``b``.

    .. note:: Many interfaces return the rich :py:class:`~.Edge` type for its added usability.
              To access an edge value, using :py:class:`slice` such as ``graph[a:b]`` is sufficient, however.

    Similar to :py:class:`Mappings`, nodes are the primary keys of a :py:class:`~.Graph`.
    As a result, the container interfaces, such as ``iter`` and ``len``, operate on nodes.
    In general, nodes can be of arbitrary type as long as they are :term:`hashable`.

    By default, edges in a :py:class:`~.Graph` are directed and unique:
    The edges represented by ``graph[a:b]`` and ``graph[b:a]`` are separate with opposite direction.
    Each edge is unique, i.e. there is only one edge ``graph[a:b]``.
    A loop is represented by the edge ``graph[a:a]``.
    The edge entities stored in the graph may be arbitrary objects.

    As such, the interface of :py:class:`~.Graph` defaults to describing a directed graph.
    However, other types of graph can be expressed as well.
    These generally do not form separate types in term of implementation.

    **Multigraphs** allow for multiple edges between pairs of nodes.
    In this case, all edge values are containers (such as :py:class:`list` or :py:class:`set`) of arbitrary size.
    Whether a :py:class:`~.Graph` is a graph of containers or a multigraph depends on the context.

    **Undirected Graphs** do not distinguish between ``graph[a:b]`` and ``graph[b:a]``.
    This can be enforced by symmetry of edge values, which guarantees that ``graph[a:b] == graph[b:a]`` always applies.

    .. describe:: g.undirected

      Indicates whether :py:class:`~.Graph` ``g`` is guaranteed to be undirected, having only
      symmetric edge values. If :py:const:`True`, ``g[a:b] is g[b:a]`` for any nodes ``a`` and ``b``
      in ``g``; the graph enforces this, e.g. ``g[a:b] = c`` implies ``g[b:a] = c``.
      If :py:const:`False`, symmetric edges are allowed but not enforced.

      Read-only unless explicitly indicated otherwise.

    There are several ways to initialise a new graph;
    their main difference is which element types are left empty.

    .. describe:: Graph()

      Create a new empty graph.
      No nodes, edges or values are filled in.

    .. describe:: Graph(graph)

      Create a new graph with all nodes, edges and values of ``graph``.
      The resulting graph is a shallow copy of ``graph`` - the identity of elements is preserved.

    .. describe:: Graph(a, b, c, ...)
                  Graph([a, b, c, ...])
                  Graph({a, b, c, ...})
                  Graph(<iterable for a, b, c, ...>)

      Create a new graph with nodes ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, ``d``, and so on.
      No edges or values are created explicitly.

    .. describe:: Graph({a: {b: ab_edge, c: ...}, b: {a: ab_edge, ...}})
                  Graph({a: AdjacencyList({b: ab_edge, c: ...}), b: AdjacencyList(...), ...})

     Create a new graph with nodes ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, and so on.
     Initialize edges to ``graph[a:b] = ab_edge``, ``graph[b:a] = ba_edge``, and so on.

    .. note::
      If only a single argument is provided, graph and mapping initialization is preferred over iterable initialisation.
      To initialize a graph with a graph or mapping as the sole node, wrap it in an iterable, e.g. ``Graph([graph])``.

    All implementations of this ABC guarantee the following operators:

    .. describe:: len(g)

      Return the number of nodes in the graph ``g``.

    .. describe:: g[a:b]

      Return the value of the edge between nodes ``a`` and ``b``. Raises :py:exc:`EdgeError` if
      no edge is defined for the nodes. Undirected graphs guarantee ``g[a:b] == g[b:a]``.

    .. describe:: g[a:b] = value

      Set the value of the edge between nodes ``a`` and ``b`` to ``value`` for graph ``g``.

    .. describe:: del g[a:b]

      Remove the edge and value between nodes ``a`` and ``b`` from ``g``.  Raises
      :exc:`EdgeError` if the edge is not in the graph.

    .. describe:: g[a]

      Return the edges between nodes ``a`` and any other node as an :py:class:`AdjacencyList`
      corresponding to ``{b: ab_edge, c: ac_edge, ...}``. Raises :py:exc:`NodeError` if
      ``a`` is not in ``g``.

    .. describe:: g[a] = None
                  g[a] = a
                  g.add(a)

      Add the node ``a`` to graph ``g`` if it does not exist. Do not add, remove or modify existing edges.
      Graphs for which edges are computed, not set, may create them implicitly.

    .. describe:: g[a] = {}
                  g[a] = AdjacencyList()

      Add the node ``a`` to graph ``g`` if it does not exist. Remove any existing
      edges originating at ``a`` from graph ``g``.

    .. describe:: g[a] = {b: ab_edge, c: ac_edge, ...}
                  g[a] = AdjacencyList(b=ab_edge, c=c_edge)

      Add the node ``a`` to graph ``g`` if it does not exist. Set the value of the edge between
      nodes ``a`` and ``b`` to ``ab_edge``, between ``a`` and ``c`` to ``ac_edge``, and so on.
      Remove any other edge from ``a``. Raises :py:exc:`NodeError` if any of ``b``,
      ``c``, etc. are not in ``g``.

    .. describe:: del g[a]

      Remove the node ``a`` and all its edges from ``g``.  Raises
      :exc:`NodeError` if the node is not in the graph.

    .. describe:: a in g

      Return :py:const:`True` if ``g`` has a node ``a``, else :py:const:`False`.

    .. describe:: Edge[a:b] in g
                  Edge(a, b) in g

      Return :py:const:`True` if ``g`` has an edge from node ``a`` to ``b``, else :py:const:`False`.

    .. describe:: iter(g)

      Return an iterator over the nodes in ``g``.

    In addition, several methods are provided. While methods and operators for
    retrieving data must be implemented by all subclasses, methods for
    modifying data may not be applicable to certain graphs.
