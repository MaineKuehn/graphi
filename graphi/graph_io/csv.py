"""
Utilities for loading and storing Graphs as csv

The CSV graph format uses an optional header to define nodes, and a body storing the adjacency matrix.
By default, a graph with ``n`` nodes is stored as a matrix literal of ``n`` columns and ``n+1`` rows::

 a  b  c  d
 0  2  1  0
 2  0  3  2
 1  4  1  0

Separators and formatting are handled by the csv :py:class:`~csv.Dialect`.
Value conversion and interpretation is handled by the appropriate reader/writer.

    Utility for reading a graph from files or iterables

    :param iterable: an iterable yielding lines of CSV, such as an open file
    :param nodes_header: whether and how to interpret a header specifying nodes
    :param literal_type: type callable to evaluate literals
    :param valid_edge: callable to test whether an edge should be inserted
    :param undirected: whether to mirror the underlying matrix

    The ``iterable`` argument can be any object that returns a line of
    input for each iteration step, such as a file object or a list of strings.

    Nodes are created depending on the value of ``nodes_header``:

    :py:const:`False`
      Nodes are numbered ``1`` to ``len(iterable[0])``. Elements in the first
      line of ``iterable`` are *not* consumed by this.

    iterable
      Nodes are read from ``node_header``.

    :py:const:`True`
      Nodes are taken as the elements of the first line of ``iterable``. The
      first line is consumed by this, and not considered as containing graph
      edges. Nodes are read plainly of type :py:class:``str``, not using ``literal_type``.

    callable
      Like :py:const:`True`, but nodes are not taken as plain :py:func:`str`
      but individually interpreted via ``node_header(element)``.

    The CSV is interpreted as a matrix, where the row marks the origin of an
    edge and the column marks the destination. Thus, loops are specified on the diagonal,
    while an asymmetric matrix creates different edge values for opposite directions.
    For an ``undirected`` graph, the matrix is automatically treated as symmetric.
    Trailing empty lines may be removed.

    In the following example, the edges ``a:b`` and ``a:c`` are symmetric and there
    are no edges or self-loops ``a:a`` or ``b:b``. In contrast, ``b:c`` is 3 whereas
    ``c:b`` is ``4``, and there is a self-loop ``c:c``. The node ``d`` only has an
    ingoing edge ``b:d``, but no outgoing edges::

     a  b  c  d
     0  2  1  0
     2  0  3  2
     1  4  1  0

    If ``undirected`` evaluates to :py:const:`True`, the upper right corner is mirrored to
    the lower left. Note that the diagonal *must* be provided. The following
    matrices give the same output if ``symmetric`` is :py:const:`True`::

     a  b  c    a  b  c    a  b  c
     0  2  1    0  2  1    0  2  1
     2  0  3       0  3    5  0  3
     1  4  1          1    7     1

    Each value is evaluated and filtered by ``literal_type`` and ``valid_edge``:

    .. function:: literal_type(literal) -> object

        Fields read from the csv are passed to `literal_type` directly as the
        sole argument. The return value is considered as final, and inserted
        into the graph without further conversions.

    .. function:: valid_edge(object) -> bool

        Similarly, `valid_edge` is called on the result of `literal_type`.
        The default is :py:func:`bool`, which should work for most data types.

    The default for ``literal_type`` is capable of handling regular python literals,
    e.g. :py:class:`int`, :py:class:`float` and :py:class:`str`. In combination with
    `valid_edge`, any literal of non-True values signifies a missing edge:
    `None`, `False`, `0` etc.

    :see: All ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` are passed on directly to
          :py:class:`csv.reader` for extracting lines.
