    Implement a callable as a graph operator

    :param prefix:

    Adds the operator lookup and fallback procedure to allow
    :py:class:`~graphi.abc.Graph` subclasses to implement optimized algorithms.
    For example, a graph storing edges in a sorted data structure may prematurely
    end a search for neighbours given a maximum distance.

    A graph can influence the evaluation of a graph operator by providing an attribute
    named ``__<prefix>_<operator name>__``, e.g. ``__graphi_neighbours__`` for an operator ``neighbours``.
    If this is the case, the attribute is called with the provided arguments as a replacement
    for the operator implementation.

    .. py:function:: operator(graph, *args, **kwargs)

        The generic implementation of a graph operator.

    .. py:method:: graph.__graphi_operator__(*args, **kwargs)

        The optimized implementation of a graph operator.

    There are three special conditions to this procedure:

    attribute is :py:const:`None`
        The graph does not support the operation.

        Attempting the operation on the graph raises :py:exc:`TypeError`.

    attribute is :py:const:`NotImplemented`
        The graph does not overwrite the operation.
        The operator implementation is used.

    calling the attribute returns :py:const:`NotImplemented`
        The graph does not overwrite the operation for the specific parameters.
        The operator implementation is used.

    The name of an operator is derived from ``operator.__name__`` or ``operator.__class__.__name__``.
