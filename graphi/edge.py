    An edge in a graph as a pair of nodes

    :param start: the start or tail of an edge
    :param stop: the stop or head of an edge
    :param step: currently unused

    This is a verbose interface for creating edges between nodes for use in a graph.
    It allows using slice notation independent of a graph:

    .. code:: python

        >>> atb = Edge[a:b]
        >>> a2b = Edge(a, b)
        >>> graph[a2b] = 1337
        >>> graph[a:b] == graph[atb] == graph[a2b] == graph[Edge[a:b]] == graph[Edge(a, b)]
        True

    A :py:class:`~.Edge` can also be used for explicit containment tests:

    .. code:: python

        >>> Edge[a:b] in graph
        True

    In addition to their slice-like nature, :py:class:`Edge` is iterable and indexable.
    This allows for easy unpacking:

    .. code:: python

        >>> edge = Edge[a:b]
        >>> tail, head = edge

    .. note:: This class creates a representation of an edge as a connection between nodes.
              Edge *values* can be arbitrary objects.

    .. warning:: Even though :py:class:`~.Edge` behaves like a :py:class:`slice` in graphs,
                 builtin containers such as :py:class:`list` cannot use a :py:class:`~.Edge`.
