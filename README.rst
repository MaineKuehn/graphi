``GraphI`` is a lightweight graph library - it is suitable to model networks, connections and other relationships.
Compared to other graph libraries, ``GraphI`` aims for being as pythonic as possible.
If you are comfortable using ``list``, ``dict`` or other types, ``GraphI`` is intuitive and straight-forward to use.

.. code::

    # create a graph with initial nodes
    airports = Graph("New York", "Rio", "Tokyo")
    # add connections between nodes
    airports["New York":"Rio"] = timedelta(hours=9, minutes=50)
    airports["New York":"Tokyo"] = timedelta(hours=13, minutes=55)

At its heart, ``GraphI`` is built to integrate with Python's data model.
It natively works with primitives, iterables, mappings and whatever you need.
For example, creating a multigraph is as simple as using multiple edge values:

.. code::

    # add multiple connections between nodes
    airports["Rio":"Tokyo"] = timedelta(days=1, hours=2), timedelta(days=1, hours=3)

With its general-purpose design, ``GraphI`` makes no assumptions about your data.
You are free to use whatever is needed to solve your problem.
